## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Backend Setup

```bash
cd Task-1/server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Server will start on:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

---

### 2️⃣ Frontend Setup

cd Task-1/client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend will run on:

```

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

* User signs up or logs in
* JWT token is generated by backend
* Token is stored in `localStorage`
* Protected routes use `x-auth-token` header

---

## 🖼️ Image Upload Flow

1. User selects an image
2. Image is sent using `multipart/form-data`
3. Multer uploads the image to Cloudinary
4. Cloudinary returns a secure URL
5. URL is saved in MongoDB

---

## 📸 Screens Included

* Landing Page (Explore Gallery)
* Signup / Login
* User Dashboard
* Upload Artwork Form
* Public Profile Page

---

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

* Full‑stack project structure
* JWT authentication implementation
* File upload handling
* Cloudinary integration
* Protected routes in React
* Clean UI with Tailwind

---

## 📌 Notes

* Make sure MongoDB and Cloudinary credentials are correct
* Backend must be running before frontend
* Images are stored in Cloudinary, not locally
